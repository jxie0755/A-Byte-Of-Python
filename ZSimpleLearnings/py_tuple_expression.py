# Contrary to popular belief, you don't need parentheses to create tuples:

x = 1,
print(type(x))
# >>> <class 'tuple'>

# However
print(type(1,))   # Equivalent to type(1)
# >>> <class 'int'>
# because , can be used as a comma in type()

print(type((1,)))  # or type((1,),)
# >>> <class 'tuple'>

# This is essentially same idea of:
for x, y in enumerate(['a', 'b', 'c']):
    print(x, y)
# >>>
# 0 a
# 1 b
# 2 c
# where we use x, y to represent (x, y) as a tuple
