P027 Quadratic primes

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
n^2+n+41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0≤n≤39. However,
when n=40, 40^2+40+41 = 40(40+1)+41 is divisible by 41,
and certainly when n=41,41^2+41+41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n^2−79n+1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0≤n≤79.
The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:
n^2+an+b, where |a|<1000 and |b|≤1000

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.
