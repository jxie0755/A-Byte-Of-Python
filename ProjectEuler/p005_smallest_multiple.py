# P005 Smalest multiple


# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Brutal force will not work as the number is too big
# use greatest common divisor, to calculate
