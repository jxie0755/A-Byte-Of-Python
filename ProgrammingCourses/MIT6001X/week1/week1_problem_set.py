# Week 1 exam is about strings, iteration, branch, while loop, for loop

# P1
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
# Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s.
# Valid vowels are: "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u".
# For example, if s = "azcbobobegghakl", your program should print:
# Number of vowels: 5

s = "azcbobobegghakl"
vnum = 0
for char in s:
    if char == "a" or char == "e"or char == "i" or char == "o"or char == "u":
        vnum += 1
print("Number of vowels:", vnum)

# P2
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
# Write a program that prints the number of times the string "bob" occurs in s.
# For example, if s = "azcbobobegghakl", then your program should print:
# Number of times bob occurs is: 2

s = "bobbjobooobobybobobbobobioboo"
print(len(s))
vnum = 0
n = 0
while n <= (len(s) - 2):
    if s[n:n+3] == "bob":
        vnum += 1
    n += 1
print("Number of times bob occurs is:", vnum)


# P3
# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
# Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order.
# For example, if s = "azcbobobegghakl", then your program should print
# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
# In the case of ties, print the first substring.
# For example, if s = "abcbcd", then your program should print
# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
# Note: This problem may be challenging. We encourage you to work smart. If you"ve spent more than a few hours on this problem, we suggest that you move on to a different part of the course. If you have time, come back to this problem after you"ve had a break and cleared your head.

            n = 1 + len(s)  # 先结束while loop
            break   # 再结束for loop,这时候,同时也确保了整个loop就此终结
            # 如果先break for loop,那么n=1+len(s)就永远不会之行,这样就不能有效终止while loop
