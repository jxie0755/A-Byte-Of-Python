# p551 Student Attendance Record I
# Easy

# You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
# 'A' : Absent. 'L' : Late. 'P' : Present.
# A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
# You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.
# 'LLL' is considered two 'LL'
