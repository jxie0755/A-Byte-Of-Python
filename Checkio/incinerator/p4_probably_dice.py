"""
For each test, assume all the dice are the same and are numbered from 1 to the number of sides, inclusive.
So a 4-sided die (D4) would have an equal chance of rolling a 1, 2, 3 or 4. A 20-sided die (D20) would have an equal chance of rolling any number from 1 to 20.
Tips: Be careful if you want to use a brute-force solution -- you could have a very, very long wait for edge cases.

Input: Three arguments. The number of dice, the number of sides per die and the target number as integers.
Output: The probability of getting exactly target number on a single roll of the given dice as a float.
