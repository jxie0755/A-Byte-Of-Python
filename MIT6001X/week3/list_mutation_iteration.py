# YOU SHOULD AVOID MUTATING A LIST WHEN ITERATING OVER IT!!!

    # L1_copy = L1[:]      # add this line could avoid the problem

# >>> [2, 3, 4]
# not as expected to be [3, 4]

# python uses an internal counter to keep track of index when in loop
# mutating changes the list during iteration changed list length, but index counter was not updated
