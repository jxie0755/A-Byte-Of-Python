# A regular polygon has n number of sides. Each side has length s.

# The area of a regular polygon is:

# The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon

# Write a function called polysum that takes 2 arguments, n and s.
# This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of the regular polygon.
# The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.
